I recently completed a Certificate in Data Analytics, Big Data, and Predictive Analytics at Ryerson University in Toronto. A requirement of the program was a capstone project using skills I had attained from the program.  

My project used a publicly available dataset provided from the Toronto Fires Services.  Similar information is sent to the Ontario Fire Marshal reporting all incidents the Toronto Fire Services responds to. The dataset includes data collected from 2011 - 2016 with 116 attributes. 

The question for my project: The Analysis of whether a given set of 13 variables of interest are ‘good’ predictors of fire fighter injuries?
